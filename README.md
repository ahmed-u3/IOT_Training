## Lectures

In the lectures directory, you will find comprehensive lecture notes and presentations for each topic covered in the IoT course. These materials will help you understand the concepts, principles, and technologies behind IoT. Feel free to explore the subdirectories for each lecture to find related resources and code examples.

## Tasks

The tasks directory contains practical tasks and assignments designed to reinforce your understanding of IoT concepts and provide you with hands-on experience. Each task has its own subdirectory, complete with detailed instructions, code templates, and any required datasets. 



## Final Project
Our final project showcases the practical application of IoT concepts and technologies. The project consists of three main components:

1. **Smart Home:** A smart home system that incorporates various sensors and actuators for enhanced security, convenience, and energy efficiency.

2. **Smart Garage:** A smart garage solution that allows remote monitoring of parking spaces' occupancy .

3. **Robot Car:** An autonomous robot car equipped with line tracking sensors, capable of navigating and parking itself in the smart garage.

In the `Final_Project` directory, you will find the following resources:

- **PowerPoint Presentation:** A detailed presentation explaining the project's architecture, components, features, and technologies used.

- **ESP32 Code Folder:** The code for implementing the smart home, smart garage, and robot car functionalities on ESP32 microcontrollers.

- **Flutter Code Folder:** The code for the mobile app that controls and monitors the smart home, smart garage, and robot car components.

- **Pictures Folder:** Immerse yourself in visual representations of our project components, captured through pictures that depict the robot, garage, and smart home elements in action.

- **SolidWorks Folder:** This directory features intricate SolidWorks design renderings of the robot, garage, and smart home, offering an insightful look into their structural design.

- **Schema Folder:** Within this directory, discover meticulously crafted schematic diagrams showcasing the layout and configuration of the robot, garage, and smart home setups.

- **Videos Folder:** Experience the project's dynamism firsthand through videos that highlight the operational capabilities of the robot, garage, and smart home features.

## Smart Home Features

- **Gate Access Control:** The gate can be opened using a password input.
- **Fan Control:** The fan can be remotely controlled using a mobile app.
- **Gas and Flame Sensors:** These sensors detect gas leaks and flames, triggering an emergency mode.
- **IR-Based Inside Door:** The inside door opens automatically when someone approaches it.
- **Automated Window:** The window automatically opens during daylight and closes when it rains.
- **LED Control:** An LED can be controlled remotely via the mobile app.

## Smart Garage Features

- **IR Sensors:** Four infrared sensors indicate the occupancy status of parking spaces.
- **OLED Display:** An OLED screen displays parking status information.
- **Mobile App Integration:** Parking status is also accessible through a mobile app.

## Robot Car Features

- **Line Tracking Sensors:** Three line tracking sensors allow the robot car to follow lines on the ground.
- **Remote Parking:** The robot car can be directed to park itself in the smart garage using the mobile app.
